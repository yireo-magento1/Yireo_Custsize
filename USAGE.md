# Usage
The product-attribute **Customer Size** is automatically added during installation. Afterwards, the attributes
behaviour (or presence in attribute-sets) can be modified from within the **Attribute Management** backend. To allow
for a product to be profile-aware, modify its **Customer Size** value to be **Yes**.
