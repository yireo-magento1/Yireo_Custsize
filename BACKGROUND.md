# Description
This extension offers in short Customer Size Profiles to Magento. Such a profile is a collection of data, specified by the customer, containing values like the weight, body length or back-waist lenght - important values when clothings is custom-made per order. Instead of re-entering those data over-and-over again, the customer is able to maintain a profile with all relevant data, and apply that profile to a product to be ordered.

A customer can create multiple profiles within his or her account, but the Magento administrator is also able to administrate profiles from within the backend: Profiles can be added, edited or removed.

A product can then be made aware of these data by setting the product-attribute Customer Size to Yes. On the product-page the customer will be asked to select the right profile. When not logged in, the customer is required to login first. Once the product is ordered, all data attached to the choosen customer profile is copied to the order. In other words, when the profile is modified afterwards, the data inside the order are not modified. The profile-values that are copied to the order are available during the checkout, in various order-emails, as well as in order management.
